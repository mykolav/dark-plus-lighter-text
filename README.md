# dark-plus-lighter-text

The Dark+ (default dark) theme from VSCode.

Two colors have been adjusted.
  1. comment: #71a35c -- so that comments are visible better on a dark background
  2. meta.tag: #d9d9d9 -- to play nicer with the ["language-vscode-javascript-angular2"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nwallace.language-vscode-javascript-angular2) extension which uses the "meta.tag" color to highlight portions of html templates of Ng components.
